# Undergradute Final Year Project - Lesion Detection

My B.Sc. (Hons.) in Computer Engineering Final Year Project

Title: Image Processing Techniques for Lung Lesion Detection in Chest CT Scans

The repo has the report as well as the system developed. A poster used for an exhibition is also included.

The system extracts images from DICOM files, pre-processes them, selects the lungs and performs detection.
More details about this can be obtained from the report.

The following results were obtained:
* True Positive Rate - 76.27%
* False Positive Rate - 7.88 Lesions per scan
* False Negative Rate -0.59 Lesions per scan
* Average Time Taken (tested on Intel Core i7-6700HQ CPU, clocked at 2.60GHz) - 74.3ms per slice
